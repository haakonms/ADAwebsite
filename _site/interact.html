<p>This was also one of our research questions, and somewhere we thought that it was possible to also find some patterns in whether one can detect if a user is a troll.
If you want to skip to that part, click <a href="./userdetect.html">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="distribution-of-all-users">Distribution of all users</h4>

<p><img src="/interacting/allusersdistributionmain.png" alt="DIstribution of the users that interact and have interactions" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disclaimer: The number of users that have interactions from others are skewed in this plot. The green bars could and should probably be a little bit higher, especially remarked in the bucket (0,10]. The blue bars still account for what it is meant to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Most users tweet under 500 times, but the difference is not is not very huge between users that have tweeted less than 500 times and users that have tweeted over 500 times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a fraction of users that have tweeted in such small numbers, so the impact of them is very small. Here we can see that the more tweets the users have the more likely it is that interactions with other trolls increases as well, which is natural.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most interesting aspect is probably the mastodonts that have tweeted over 10000 times. These users have a lot higher fraction of those being interacted with by other users than interacting themselves, even though the large amount of tweets. This differs significantly from the user with between 1000 and 10000 tweets, which is weird. In general, the higher tweet count the more even the three bars would be, as it seems that this is the natural way the relationship between the three bars evolve.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cumulative-distribution-of-how-the-trolls-interact-to-other-trolls">Cumulative distribution of how the trolls interact to other trolls</h4>

<p><img src="/interacting/cumulativeinteracting.png" alt="Cumulative distribution" /></p>

<p>To interpret this visualization:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This mean that almost 20% of the trolls have never interacted to trolls.</li>
  <li>50% of the users have more than 30% of their interactions directed to trolls, and 50% has less than 30%.</li>
  <li>Around 30% of trolls have more than 50% of their interactions directed to trolls.</li>
  <li>Around 5% of the users only interact with trolls.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, yes they do interact with each other, and some of them does it a whole lot. As we saw in <a href="./botdeciding.html">how we made the tag of bot-likely users</a>, many users also tweet exactly the same content as well, meaning that users also are connected in other forms than through interactions.</p>

<p>Since many of the trolls so clearly is interacting as an unit, we divided them into a whole bunch of categories to try to find out how normal users could detect them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the user with under 10 tweets are almost invisible to most of normal Twitter users and only half of them have ever interacted as well, we remove them for the main categorization of users. Most people will never even see those trolls, and users that never get more than ten tweets will in general been questioned as being a significant Twitter user at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore the next analysis will contain users that have a minimum of capability of impacting the general discussion, since they are or have been active at all, with that definition only being reaching a number of over 10 tweets.</p>
</blockquote>
