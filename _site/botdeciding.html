<p>Many of the tweets appeared several times in the dataset. Many of them by natural causes, since users had retweeted the same tweets and users were also retweeted internally by other bots. However, an enormous amount of original content appeared multiple times.</p>

<p>We searched for these tweets and see how many times they appeared in the dataset and look at its content.</p>

<p><img src="/botsdeciding/originaltweetshist.png" alt="Cumulative distribution" /></p>

<p>Many of the original tweets really is not really that original in the words literal sense. If you look at how many unique tweets that are tweeted more than once, the amount does not seem too surprising. However, when you look at the number of times these unique tweets has been tweeted, this clearly indicates massive use of bots. Under follows a table that shows the stats of original content in a more tidy form.</p>

<p><img src="/botsdeciding/originaltweetstable.png" alt="Table of original content" /></p>

<p>The tweets marked as original content does not include retweets, and we also removed links from them. These five tweets appeared the most.</p>

<p><img src="/botsdeciding/duplicatedtweetsexamples.png" alt="Cumulative distribution" />
The significant length of these makes it unlikely for users randomly tweeting this sequence of words. We analyzed all the text that appears 75 times or more, and concluded that only three entries needed removal: “I added a video to a @YouTube playlist”, “Comment here on” and “awesome”, since they are valid things to attach in front of links and the last one is just a single word.</p>

<p>We found out that 926 of 2286 users had this type of behaviour, which is 40,5% of the dataset. Some of them may have slipped in by randomingly tweeting the same as 75 other people, but this foremost concludes that they are a part of a network that have the same tweets.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The percentage here is taken from all users that tweet in english. In future visualizations regarding the question whether someone can detect Twitter trolls we will also limit the tweets to being “impacting” tweets which will elevate this number.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here the trolls with under 10 tweets are not included, removing 8 likely bots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When trolls come up in a certain number, it becomes more likely for them being bots. There may be subranges that have higher amount of bots than others as well, since our ranges are randomly picked to have a more distributed visualization. Most of the results here is just around its own standard deviation, especially with the followers. That the bucket  of (200, 500] followers has that low amount of likely bots is most likely a coincidence.</p>

<p>It 50 tweets, since there are also very few of these bots that fall under our likelihood, and their impact is as well limited.</p>

<p>The most interesting parts are on the right side of both subplots. Even though having the largest amount of tweets and followers, they don’t tweet the same duplicated content in spite of having a much higher sample size.</p>

<p>One can detect these users as bots on Twitter in general by searching for the same content in the search menu in Twitter. If the content appears numerous times, there is a high propability for it being a bot. More on this in <a href="./userdetect.html">Can normal Twitter users detect Russian trolls?</a>.</p>
