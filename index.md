# Introduction
Over the last several years there has been an attempt from Russian trolls to spread propaganda and fake news over social media in order to spread political ideas among the general population both nationally and internationally.

On this website a great number of these russian tweets have been analyzed and visualized. We will also look into how the trolls operate and organize themselves, trying to find patterns in the madness. Such patterns might maybe lead us to being able to detect these Russian trolls in an earlier stage.

This data story consists of four own pages, excluding this start page. You will be able to navigate by clicking on the links under here. We recommend you to read through them in the following order:

- [General stats regarding the dataset](./generalstats.html).

- [How we found the users with bot-like pattern.](./botdeciding.html).

- [Does the trolls interact with each other?](./interact.html).

- [How you may be able to detect some of the trolls.](./userdetect.html).

All the analysis here will mainly not provide you the information of how we found things out or how we coded things. If you want a total understanding of all the processes in getting to this page or just view a bunch of code, please take a look at our [notebook](Insertlink).
There we will also go through step-by-step our line of thought in this project.
