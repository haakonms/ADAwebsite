# Introduction
Over the last several years there has been an attempt from Russian trolls to spread propaganda and fake news over social media in order to spread political ideas among the general population both nationally and internationally.

On this website a great number of these russian tweets have been analyzed and visualized. We will also look into how the trolls operate and organize themselves, trying to find patterns in the madness. Such patterns might maybe lead us to being able to detect these Russian trolls in an earlier stage.

This data story consists of four own pages, excluding this start page. You will be able to navigate by clicking on the links under here. We recommend you to read through them in the following order:

- [General stats regarding the dataset](./generalstats.html).

- [How we found the users with bot-like pattern.](./botdeciding.html).

- [Does the trolls interact with each other?](./interact.html).

- [How you may be able to detect some of the trolls.](./userdetect.html).

All the analysis here will mainly not provide you the information of how we found things out or how we coded things. If you want a total understanding of all the processes in getting to this page or just view a bunch of code, please take a look at our [notebook](Insertlink).
There we will also go through step-by-step our line of thought in this project.

## Additional information about the pages

### 1. General stats regarding the dataset.
[This page](./generalstats.html) shows a bunch of many visualizations of basic statistics. 
How often did the trolls tweet? At which time of the day? Were they more active during the election? What is the highest amount of followers a troll has had?
These questions amongst others will be answered.

### 2. How we found the users with bot-like pattern.
[This page](./botdeciding.html) shows the methods we used to find out and decide which users we would go on to categorize as likely being bots. This may be useful to better understand how to detect the trolls. 

### 3. Does the trolls interact with each other?
[This page](./interact.html) shows how the Twitter trolls interact with each other and in which scale they do it. 

### 4. How you may be able to detect some of the trolls.
[This page](./userdetect.html) give you an insight in if it is possible to detect some of the Russian Twitter trolls, as well as providing statistics for how the users are divided into different classifications.


#### Technical information

If you want to check all our work for this project, go check out our 
[ github repo for the project](https://github.com/haakonms/ADAproject).

Our repo for the website can be found [here](https://github.com/haakonms/ADAwebsite).

We used two different datasets for this project. One was created by two researchers at Clemson University, and contains some cool features as classification of the accounts into categories. The set can be downloaded and read about [here](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets).

The other dataset was released by Twitter this autumn. We only have it on our own Drive, but we can share it by request.

Thanks for your time!
